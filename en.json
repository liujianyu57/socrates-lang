  "textBeginnerClass0104": "Criteria: After choosing an answer, a user is ranked within the top 100 among the participants who answered the question.",
  "textBeginnerClass0105": "Eligibility for rewards: Assuming you chose A, at the end of the question, option A receives the most votes. Then you will receive an award along with other users who vote for option A.",

  "textBeginnerClass0107": "Prize amount: Prize pool amount * 100/Total number of voters",
  "textBeginnerClass0108": "How do I understand the Type 1 Discussion Prize?",
  "textBeginnerClass0109": "This type of reward is distributed relatively evenly, that is, all winners share the prize pool together, and the only thing that causes different rewards is the Pens held by each winner.",

  "textBeginnerClass0113": "Reward coefficients: Coefficient 1: Based on the type and number of Pens (coefficients of NFT Pens can be added together), the higher the level of the Pen, the greater the coefficient.

  "textBeginnerClass0116": "1. This type of reward features a larger difference in reward distribution and is more competitive. Apart from the factor that users hold different Pens, the more important thing is the voting percentage increase of the option you voted for when a question ends*.",
  "textBeginnerClass0117": "2. You may be awarded regardless of whether the option was the majority's choice or the minority's choice at the time of your vote.",
  "textBeginnerClass0118": "*At the early stage of voting, it's relatively easy to see a significant increase in voting when there are fewer participants. The closer the question is to the deadline, the harder it is to achieve the same increase.
